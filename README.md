# BusTracker
**MBTA Bus #1 Real Time Tracker**

**Description:** This is a simple application that tracks the buses that are in transit for route # 1 between Harvard Square and Nubian Station in Boston, MA. It fetches real time data from MBTA data-source to provide user with current location of buses in route. The color of the bus indicates the direction: inbound (Nubian) or outbound (Harvard).

**How to run:** Just launch the website to run the application. The data refreshes every 15 seconds with the new bus locations.

**Roadmap:** Future interesting improvements for users would be to have the estimated time for the next bus to arrive at a specific bus stop. The roadmap for this improvement is still TBD.
