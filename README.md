# BusTracker
**MBTA Bus #1 Real Time Tracker**

**Description:** This is a simple application that tracks the buses that are in transit for route # 1 between Harvard Square and Nubian Station in Boston, MA. It fetches real time data from MBTA data-source to provide user with current location of buses in route. The color of the bus indicates the direction: inbound (Nubian) or outbound (Harvard).

**Usage:** This application can be used to check how far the next bus will arrive at your location.

**Roadmap:** Future improvements may be available to show the route on the map. This is still TBD.
